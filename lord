    Venkateswara, an avatar of Vishnu, is the presiding deity of the Tirupati temple.
    It is believed that the deity is Swayambhu (self manifested).
    The deity possesses the power of the Trimurti: Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva,
    and some sects believe that Venkateswara holds the power of Shakthi and Skanda as well.
